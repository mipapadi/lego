<h3 id="letslookatlegosets\">Let's look at Lego sets!</h3>
<p>Lego is a household name across the world, supported by a diverse toy line, hit movies, and a series of successful video games. In this project, we are going to explore a key development in the history of Lego: the introduction of licensed sets such as Star Wars, Super Heroes, and Harry Potter.</p>
<p>It may not be widely known, but Lego has had its share of ups and downs since its inception in the early 20th century. This includes a particularly rough period in the late 90s. As described in <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/how-lego-made-a-huge-turnaround-2014-2?r=US&IR=T\">this article</a>, Lego was only able to survive due to a successful internal brand (Bionicle) and the introduction of its first licensed series: Star Wars.</p>
<p>Before diving into our analysis though, let's become familiar with the two datasets that will help us with this project:<br></p>
<div style="background-color: #ebf4f7; color: #595959; text-align:left; vertical-align: middle; padding: 15px 25px 15px 25px; line-height: 1.6;\">
    <div style="font-size:20px\"><b>lego_sets.csv</b></div>
<ul>
    <li><b>set_num:</b> A code that is unique to each set in the dataset. <b><i>This column is critical, and a missing value indicates the set is a duplicate or invalid!</i></b></li>
    <li><b>set_name:</b> A name for every set in the dataset (note that this can be the same for different sets).</li>
    <li><b>year:</b> The date the set was released.</li>
    <li><b>num_parts:</b> The number of parts contained in the set.<b><i> This column is not central to our analyses, so missing values are acceptable.</i></b></li>
        <li><b>theme_name:</b> The name of the sub-theme of the set.</li>
    <li><b>parent_theme:</b> The name of the parent theme the set belongs to. Matches the 'name' column of the 'parent_themes' csv file.</li>
</ul>
<div style="font-size:20px\"><b>parent_themes.csv</b></div>
<ul>
    <li><b>id:</b> A code that is unique to every theme.</li>
    <li><b>name:</b> The name of the parent theme.</li>
    <li><b>is_licensed:</b> A Boolean column specifying whether the theme is a licensed theme.</li>
</ul>
    </div>
<br>
<p>With this mini project, it is supposed to be presented some of my skills with datasets and data vizualization techniques. Always using Jupyter Notebook, Python, Pandas and Plotly.
